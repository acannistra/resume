{\bf Tufts University Computational Biology Research Group}, {\em Researcher}, May 2013--Present\\
\vspace*{-.15in} 
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1pt]
    \item Worked with Professors Benjamin Hescott and Lenore Cowen on protein function prediction.
    \item Developed and implemented algorithms in Python that built upon Hescott and Cowen's Diffusion State Distance (DSD) metric to incorporate genetic protein-protein interaction data into function prediction.
    \item Worked with large protein interaction datasets and graph algorithms.
    \item Currently writing scientific paper describing results for submission to RECOMB 2014.
